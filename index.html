                <p>My name is Jesus M. Arellano III Born into a prominent New England family in 1837, J.P. Morgan began his career in the New York financial industry in the late 1850s. He co-founded the banking firm that became J.P. Morgan & Co. in 1871, and in the 1880s he established himself as a power player in the country's railroad industry. Along with amassing immense wealth through the creation of such corporations as U.S. Steel, Morgan led efforts to bail out the U.S. Treasury in 1895 and 1907. He died in Rome in 1913, leaving behind a world-renowned art collection and a business that remained a financial powerhouse into the 21st century.</p>
